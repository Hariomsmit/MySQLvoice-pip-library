MySQLvoice

Description:
MySQLvoice is a pip library created by us during Hackathon DotSlash 5.0 (SVNIT,Surat, India). This library falls under developer tools 
which helps the developer to take inputs from the user via voice recognition technology developed using prebuilt python library called
SpeechRecognition to recognize the keywords and use them as Standard Query generators. Using this library user doesn't need to know 
SQL database languages to make any changes or  to know anything about their database. We have announced eight new keywords as follows:
1)mycursor    -> To name yout MySQL cursor
2)tablename1  -> To name your First table
3)tablename2  -> To name your second table
4)t1c1        ->To name first column of your tablename1
5)t1c2        ->To name second column of your tablename1
6)t1c3        ->To name third column of your tablename1
7)t2c1        ->To name first column of your tablename2
8)t2c2        ->To name second column of your tablename2
Apart from this we need three preinstalled pip libraries as follows:
1) speech_recognition
2) pyaudio
3) mysql.connector


How to Install and Run the Project:

Once the MySQLvoice pip package is uploaded on PyPI, you can directly write "pip install MySQLvoice" in your respective terminals 
to install it in your system. After installing you can import it in your Python compiler and get benefited.


How to Use the Project:

This Project is limited to MySQL Database operations but it can be used in all regions of the world for handeling databases as 
it is very easy to develop for regional languages. We are mostly working in common English language but it has the capability
to be coded for any languages spoken in the world like Kannada, Korean, Japenese, Hindi, Gujrati etc. It will help the Non-Technical 
person to handle databases with ease.
